# Basic knowledge about DataBase

## Schema vs Catalog

- A computer may have one cluster or multiple.
- A database server is a cluster.
- A cluster has catalogs. ( Catalog = Database )
- Catalogs have schemas. (Schema = namespace of tables, and security boundary)
- Schemas have tables.
- Tables have rows.
- Rows have values, defined by columns.
- Those values are the business data your apps and users care about such as person's name, invoice due date, product price, gamerâ€™s high score. The column defines the data type of the values (text, date, number, and so on).
